### About Me
<div id="text_presentation">
  <p>
    üë§ I have a degree in Nutrition from UniCEUB in Bras√≠lia, Brazil, and a master's degree in Training Engineering from the University of Nantes, France. This academic background gave me a combination of skills that reaches different disciplines.

 
  </p>

  <br>
 
  <p>
    ‚úàÔ∏è As a multidisciplinary person, throughout my life, I have acquired experience in different areas, making me capable of adapting to different environments and challenges. Having lived in Brazil, Portugal, Italy and France, I have cultivated a global perspective and a deep appreciation for cultural diversity. These experiences have not only enriched my personal life, but also provided me with a unique set of skills that I can leverage in my new career in IT.
    <br><br>
    üåê Along this path, I became proficient in four languages ‚Äã‚Äã(Portuguese, English, Italian and French) and I have strong communication skills that allow me to interact effectively with people from different backgrounds and cultures. This multilingual capability enables me to seamlessly collaborate with international teams and easily navigate global business environments.
    <br><br>
    ‚ôüÔ∏è Furthermore, I consider myself a self-taught person and, therefore, I am always willing to learn when facing new challenges. My curiosity and enthusiasm for exploring different areas make me an adaptable and versatile professional, always willing to expand my knowledge and experience. This proactive mindset can help me keep up with the dynamism and constant evolution of the IT area.
  </p>

  <br>
  
  <p>
    üîß In my previous role, as a master in Training Engineering, I improved my skills in developing and managing training programs, with a focus on improving communication strategies and promoting a cohesive work environment. This experience in resolving internal challenges to increase productivity gives me the ability to contribute effectively to projects, bringing a new perspective and possible innovative solutions.
  </p>

  <br>
  
  <p>
    üìö Driven by a thirst for new knowledge, I entered the IT world and currently work as a FullStack Developer at @ToMaisVip. In this company, I had the opportunity to grow quickly, starting as an intern and becoming a key team member. I participated in decision-making and helped in code architecture, which provided me with great knowledge, expertise, and competence in the field.
    <br><br>
    üíª My diverse education and skills make me a valuable professional in IT. I am excited to use my passion for programming and diverse experiences to contribute to projects and teams while continuing to enhance my knowledge.
